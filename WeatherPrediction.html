                <p>The prediction of the weather forecasts has always been notoriously unreliable, you can often hear it remarked that you should never trust the weather forecast however with the implementation of technology the accuracy and foresight that can be provided has greatly improved. </p>
                <h2>History of Weather Forecasting</h2>
                <p>Weather Prediction was first studied by the Navy in an attempt to lessen the volume of ships lost to storms at sea. As they made advances they realised that the information they gathered could also be of use to other industries such as agriculture. The first way of predicting the weather was using instruments such as barometers to measure atmospheric pressures. This however could not provide foresight into what the weather would look like in the future. The first way of sharing this information to a wider audience was using telegraphs to convey information collected in different locations. </p>
                <p>In 1854 the Meteorological Department or Met Office was founded, the office provided instruments for Royal Navy ships to gather data for computation. 15 stations were set up around the country which provided daily weather reports at set times to the Met Office. In 1911 the Met Office started issuing marine weather forecasts via Radio Transmission. Later in 1936 the first televised weather forecast was shown on the BBC.</p>
                <p>The first weather forecast using a modern computer was in 1950 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. John von Neumann put together a team of meteorologists and together they used ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer), the world’s first general purpose computer, to complete a 24 hour forecast. The forecast took 24 hours to compute including the time taken to load the punch cards however it clearly showed that if the speed of computation could be increased then the future of weather forecasting lied in computers. </p>
                <p>In 1966 a computer model was created for the atmosphere improving on predictions made humans. In 1992 computers were used to draw surface analysis which is a weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area such as temperature, rainfall or cloud cover.</p>
                <h2>Supercomputers for Weather Forecasting</h2>
                <p>The Met Office installed a cutting edge supercomputer in 2016 which was 15 times more powerful than it’s predecessor. Some facts about the Cray XC40:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Are capable of over 14,000 trillion arithmetic operations per second – that’s more than 2 million calculation per second for every man, woman and child on the planet.</li>
                  <li>Contain 2 petabytes of memory enough to hold 200 trillion numbers</li>
                  <li>Contain a total of 460,000 compute cores. These are faster versions of those found in a typical quad-core laptop.</li>
                  <li>Contain 24 petabytes of storage for saving data - enough to store over 100 years worth of HD movies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The supercomputer allows them to run detailed models every hour as opposed to three hours meaning that the information given to the public is more up to date. The advances in technology mean that a 4 day forecast today is as accurate as a 1 day forecast was 30 years ago.</p>
